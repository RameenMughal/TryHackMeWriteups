# Pentesting Fundamentals 

## What is Penetration Testing?

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. 

A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

## Penetration Testing Ethics

A penetration test is an authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. 

The legality of penetration is pretty clear-cut in this sense; anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised.

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on.

Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into.

•	**White Hat**: These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.

•	**Grey Hat**: These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.

•	**Black Ha**t: These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

### Rules of Engagement(ROE)

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. 

This document consists of three main sections which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. 

•	**Permission**: This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.

•	**Test Scope**: This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.

•	**Rules**: The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology.

Before discussing some different industry-standard methodologies, we should note that all of them have a general theme of the following stages:

•	**Information Gathering**: This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research. This does not involve scanning any systems.

•	**Enumeration/Scanning**: This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

•	**Exploitation**: This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

•	**Privilege Escalation**: Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).

•	**Post-Exploitation**: This stage involves a few sub-stages: What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting), What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user, Covering your tracks and Reporting

### OSSTMM

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

1.	Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)

2.	Wired Networks

3.	Wireless communications

### OWASP

The "Open Web Application Security Project" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

The foundation regularly writes reports stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

### NCSC CAF

The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

•	Data security

•	System security

•	Identity and access control

•	Resiliency (the capacity to withstand or to recover quickly from difficulties)

•	Monitoring

•	Response and recovery planning

### Answer the questions below

1. What stage of penetration testing involves using publicly available information?

Information Gathering

2. If you wanted to use a framework for pentesting telecommunications, what framework would you use? Note: We're looking for the acronym here and not the full name. 

OSSTMM

3. What framework focuses on the testing of web applications? 

OWASP

## Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing

We'll cover these three different scopes of testing.

### Black Box

This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.

The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. 

### Grey Box

This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. 

The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software

### White Box

This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. 

The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.

### Answer the questions below

1. You are asked to test an application but are not given access to its source code - what testing process is this? 

Black Box

2. You are asked to test a website, and you are given access to the source code - what testing process is this? 

White Box

## Practical: ACME Penetration Test

First Rules of Engagement is done containing three sections: Permission, Test of Scope and Rules.

In Information Gathering stage, we can see that Abbey has email ID in the LinkedIn Profile which can be used to target the laptop.

In Enumeration/Scanning, we get the ACME web server IP address in which Abbey posted is 96.37.50.151. Scanning this IP gives there is a web vulnerability.

In Exploitation, we will use this vulnerability to gain access to the ACME system.

In Post Exploitation, by using privilege escalation to move to high users like administrators to gain access to sensitive files that normal users are not usually given.

In Pentest Report Stage, this occurs at the end of the penetration test. You need to explain the security issues to the company and clean up the environment if any changes were made to validate the issue.
