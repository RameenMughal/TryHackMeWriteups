# Web Application Security

## Introduction

A web application is like a “program” that we can use without installation as long as we have a modern standard web browser, such as Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. Consequently, instead of installing every program you need, you only need to browse the related page. 

The idea of a web application is that it is a program running on a remote server. 

A server refers to a computer system running continuously to “serve” the clients. In this case, the server will run a specific type of program that can be accessed by web browsers.
