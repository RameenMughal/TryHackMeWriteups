## Introduction

Cryptography lays the foundation for our digital world. While networking protocols have made it possible for devices spread across the globe to communicate, cryptography has made it possible to trust this communication.

## Importance of Cryptography

Cryptography’s ultimate purpose is to ensure secure communication in the presence of adversaries. The term secure includes confidentiality and integrity of the communicated data. 

Cryptography can be defined as the practice and study of techniques for secure communication and data protection where we expect the presence of adversaries and third parties. 

In other words, these adversaries should not be able to disclose or alter the contents of the messages.

Cryptography is used to protect confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. In this age, you use cryptography daily, and you’re almost certainly reading this over an encrypted connection.
