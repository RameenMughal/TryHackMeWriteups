## Introduction to Security Awareness

Based on a report from IBM, human errors were the main reason for 95% of successful cyber attacks. The study concluded that people are the main threat to the security of a business.

## Why Security Awareness is Essential

Nowadays, remote working is common in many organizations, and many will spend most of their time working on their personal computers, which increases the risk of being a primary target for cyber security attacks.

Hackers use a variety of tools and methods to gain access to staff computers and corporate networks. Security breaches can cost a company millions of dollars; based on an online report, the average cost of a data breach was a massive $3.86 million. As well as the huge cost to handle a cyberattack, it also damages the reputation and trust of customers and partners.

## Data and Account Security

Everyone holds sensitive data, whether it be personal information, customer data, financial reports, or company details, obtaining data (or holding it to ransom) is a cybercriminal's main objective.

Sensitive data can be in many different forms. For example, the HR department has all details and information of employees while the finance department will have the credit card and bank account details of customers. Protecting this data is important not only to the organization but also to its clients and customers.

The following diagram illustrates the top 10 data breaches by some of the large companies in history, the number of people who were affected and the type of data that was leaked.
