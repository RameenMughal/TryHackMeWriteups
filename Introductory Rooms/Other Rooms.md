# Other Free Introductory Rooms

There are other free rooms which you can learn from the Introductory Rooms category. The reason there not any writeups or notes is most probably they are short introduction rooms or have been covered earlier by me as I did the PreSecurity Course for my Cybersecurity Fundamentals.

Hence here is a list of Other Introductory Rooms with links.
