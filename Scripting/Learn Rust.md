# Learn Rust 

## What is Rust?

Rust is a new programming language created in 2015 by a small team of people, and later adopted by Mozilla (the organisation that created & maintains Firefox).

Rust has 3 goals:
- Fast
- Secure
- Productive

### Fast

Rust is statically typed, which means the data type of a variable is known at compile time. This allows the compiler to optimise the code further than if we didn't know the types.

Rust does not use garbage collection (despite being a low level programming language). Garbage collection is where the program attempts to reclaim memory from garbage. Garbage is memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.
