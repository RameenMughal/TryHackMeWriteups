## Mathematical Operators

The table below shows the different operations.

| Operator        | Syntax    | Example                 |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Addition        | `+`       | `1 + 1 = 2`             |
| Subtraction     | `-`       | `5 - 1 = 4`             |
| Multiplication  | `*`       | `10 * 10 = 100`         |
| Division        | `/`       | `10 / 2 = 5`            |
| Modulus         | `%`       | `10 % 2 = 0`            |
| Exponent        | `**`      | `5 ** 2 = 25` (`5^2`)   |

Now that we know basic mathematical operators, let's move on to comparison operators;

- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Equal to: `==`
- Not Equal to: `!=`
-	Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
