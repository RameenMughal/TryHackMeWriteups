## Introduction

Creating your own custom tooling is critically important for web application red teaming, as you rarely find a tool or plugin that will do exactly what you need. This then calls for you to develop custom tooling!

Code is the most versatile option, as it allows you to create brand new software specifically for your needs. Being able to use code also allows you to take existing tools and exploits to customise them to your needs. 

While we will showcase using Python in this room, the principles can be applied to any coding language of your choice.
