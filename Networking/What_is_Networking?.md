## What is Networking ?

Networks are simply things connected. 

In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

Networks are integrated into our everyday life. Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

## What is the Internet ?

The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself.

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. 

However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). 

The Internet looks like a much larger version of this sort of diagram:

As previously stated, the Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.  These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks or the Internet! 

So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:
- A private network
- A public network
