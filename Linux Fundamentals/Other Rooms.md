# Other Rooms 

Rooms that are not available in the repository were either short to write any important notes or were completed before as I have completed the PreSecurity Course for Cybersecurity fundamentals. 

Hence here are other free rooms for Linux Fundamentals:

1. [Linux Fundamentals Part 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)

Other Rooms of the Linux Fundamentals Modules are part of the premium subscription but dont worry, these can be covered by the Ty Hack Me official youtube channel, where they have writeups video for these rooms by them!

1. [Linux Fundamentals Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zt2Mp2IeBI&list=PL0iJrrpaWpyW9FQqI_TMJiuGpLJrXGVvA&index=2)
