## Introduction

Malware refers to software or code created to damage systems, steal information, or allow unauthorised access. It appears in many forms, each with different tactics and goals.

Malware can affect businesses in many ways, from financial loss and stolen data to disrupted services and reputational damage.

SOC analysts are responsible for spotting and responding to suspicious activity. They review security alerts and decide what action to take based on the type of threat involved. 

Classifying malware correctly helps determine the correct response, such as isolating infected machines or investigating data theft. 

This room introduces the most common malware categories, explains how to tell them apart, and includes real-world examples to support learning.
